Hibernate OGM
==================================================
Version: 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Description
-----------

Hibernate OGM is an attempt to store data in a NoSQL data grid using he Hibernate Core engine rather than rewriting a JPA engine from scratch.

The benefits are fairly obvious:
 - reimplementing the complex JPA specification is a lot of work
 - a new implementation would mature at a rather slow rate and risk of bugs would be high
 - Hibernate is familiar to many people
